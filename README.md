## Project Introduction
We based our work on [Book Recommender](https://www.kaggle.com/philippsp/book-recommender-collaborative-filtering-shiny/data), to check out how to correlate users' ratings with their preference to books. Besides the rating, users also are allowed to enter the title of book they have read, then our Book Recommendation system can figure out book recommendation solutions to our users. Also, we provide more book contents overview to help our user to learn more about these choices before they start to read. 
## Data
* Our data comes from Kaggle's data source [goodbooks](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k)
## Reference
* [Book Recommender](https://github.com/pspachtholz/BookRecommender) is a developed shiny app to explore users' preference with their rating behavior, which is now availlable on github
